# Explanation of the code:-

- The code is a number guessing game implemented in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it

- The user has a certain number of attempts to guess the correct number. If the user's guess is correct, the program prints a success message and updates the user's score

- If the user's guess is incorrect, the program gives the user a hint if the target number is greater or less than the user's guess

- The program allows the user to play a certain number of rounds, and the user's score is updated after each round. At the end of all the rounds, the program prints the user's final score

- The number of rounds and the number of attempts per round are configurable. The program uses the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the command line

- The code initializes the rounds, attempts, and score variables to keep track of the number of rounds, the number of attempts per round, and the user's score, respectively. The program enters a loop to run for the specified number of rounds

- In each round, it generates a random number between 1 and 100 to be the target number that the user needs to guess. The program then enters another loop to allow the user to make a certain number of attempts to guess the target number

- In each attempt, it prompts the user to enter a number and reads it from the command line using the Scanner class. It then checks whether the user's guess is correct, If the user's guess is correct, the loop is broken and the score is updated

- After all the rounds are completed, the program closes the Scanner and prints the user's final score



# 2) Methodolgy of choosing 3 rounds and 7 attempts:-

- The code is a number guessing game implemented in Java

- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it

- The user has a certain number of attempts to guess the correct number and the program gives hints if the guess is incorrect

- The program allows the user to play a certain number of rounds, and the user's score is updated after each round

- At the end of all the rounds, the program prints the user's final score and uses the Scanner class from the java.util package to read input from the command line



# 3) Pseudocode
- Initialize variables rounds, attempts, and score to 3, 7, and 0 respectively. Create a Scanner object for reading user input.
- Loop for the number of rounds (3):
- - Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it in a variable called target.
- - Print an empty line and the round header.
- - Loop for the number of attempts (7):
- - - Print an empty line, the number of attempts remaining, and a prompt for the user to guess a number.
- - - Read the user's input and store it in a variable called answer.
- - - If answer is correct, print a success message, increase score by 1, and break out of the attempts loop.
- - - If answer is not correct, print a message indicating whether the target is greater or less than answer.
- Close the Scanner object and print the total score.
